Typeface and imaging library and tools for color graphic calculators, using
sub-pixel rendering concepts.

forked and extended by [Peter Marheine](https://github.com/tari)
([repo](https://github.com/tari/calctype)). This repo is a re-organised
amalgamation of both, with the original tools ported to a C++ CLI.
