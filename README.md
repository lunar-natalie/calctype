# CalcType

Typeface and imaging library for color graphic calculators, using sub-pixel
rendering concepts.

Originally created by [tswilliamson](https://github.com/tswilliamson)
([repo](https://github.com/tswilliamson/calctype)). The original project was
forked and extended by [Peter Marheine](https://github.com/tari)
([repo](https://github.com/tari/calctype)). This repo is a re-organised
amalgamation of both, with the original tools ported to a C++ CLI.
